This document, which is called the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , and its associated documents (see below), set out the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined will apply to the provision of supports for participants in the NDIS. The intent of these documents is to assist participants and providers, both current and prospective, to understand the ways in which price controls work in the NDIS. Price regulation is in place to help ensure that participants receive value for money when they purchase the supports that they need . Price regulation documents NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits This document sets out the general pricing arrangements that apply to all supports in the NDIS and the specific arrangements that apply to individual supports. NDIS Support Catalogue This document provides information on the current price limits for each support item and indicates for each price -limited support item the claim types (Travel, non -face-to-face, etc.) that can be used. Requirements specified in the Support Catalogue are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined should apply to NDIS. The NDIA sometimes deactivates support items. Deactivated support items cannot be used. Before a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 8, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

Before a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support. These legacy supports are listed in a separate tab of the Support Catalogue for the information of providers and participants. Providers and participants should not create new service bookings for legacy supports. In general, claims for legacy supports should only continue to be made against a servic e booking if that service booking was in existence a t the time the support was turned into a legacy sup port. Addenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits These documents allow the NDIA to respond to changing market conditions in an efficient manner. They are used to make temporary changes to some of the support items and arrangements listed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .

Requirements specified in Addenda are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has determined will apply to NDIS. • NDIS Bereavement Addendum : lists support items that providers can claim after a NDIS participant has died.

Providers of these supports are also subject to the general arrangements set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model The NDIA uses the Disability Support Worker Cost Model that is described within this document to determine the price limits for supports that are delivered by Disability Support Workers (DSWs). The DSW Cost Model estimates the fully loaded cost of a billable hour of support considering: base pay; shift loadings; leave entitlements; salary on costs; employee allowances; operational overheads (including supervision costs, utilisation costs and work ers’ compensation costs); corporate overheads and margin. The NDIA expects that providers pay their disability support workers in accordance with relevant awards and agreements. Participants should expect that the price for services is in line with the quality and cost of service provision. For example, where pro viders employ DSWs in line with Social and Community Services Employees section for the SCHADS Industry Award, a price for services at the limit would be justified", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 9, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

These categories can be relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for providers when seeking payment for delivered supports. Support Items Each support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items listed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue . Providers should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they have delivered. Each support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure: For example: 01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self -Care Activities – Standard – Saturday Support Category Sequence Number Registration Group Outcome Domain Support Purpose 01 013 0107 1 1 Support Purpose s NDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purpose s: 1. CORE – Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes ( i.e., capital or capacity building supports). 2. CAPITAL – Investments, such as assistive technologies – equipment, home or vehicle modifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan. 3. CAPACITY BUILDING – Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and skills", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 12, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and overall per formance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are r equired.

Falsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the provider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to au dit. Conflicts of Interest in the NDIS Provider Market In line with the NDIA Position Statement on Conflicts of Interest in the NDIS Provider Market , providers are expected to make all efforts to avoid conflicts of interest. They should declare all conflicts of interest when they occur and be open with participants, their supports, or representatives with any conflicts of interest and associated risks and discuss options to manage these risks. Providers should document strategies for monitoring confl icts of interest. The Position Statement states the limited circumstances where a conflict of interest may be unavoidable.

Service Agreements A Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider.

Service Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They can include information such as: • What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide; • The prices of those supports and services; • How, when and where the supports and services are provided; • The duration of the Service Agreement and w hen and how the Agreement will be reviewed; • How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement; • How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled; • Participant responsibilit ies under the Service Agreement; and • Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 16, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the myplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each service booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of service delivery within the plan dates. Servic e bookings are not the same as servi ce agreements . The Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where possible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible basis, especially for on -the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must have a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information can be found on the NDIS website . My providers NDIS Plans in our PACE system don’t have service bookings. “My providers” are the providers a participant regularly works with and records as part of their NDIS plan. By recording a provider, participants are letting us know that a provider can receive payments for claims on their NDIS plan. Being recorded as my providers means less administration and time spent chasing details and following up claims. This is because my providers claims are generally paid within 2 to 3 days. Participants can still choose to use any provider, however if a claim is made by a provider who is not recorded as my providers, we’ll check with the participant or their nominee by SMS to confirm the claim is for a NDIS support they agreed to", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 17, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

In these cases, the provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the time that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community participation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non -labour costs associated with transporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support). The worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the total time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent accompanying and/or transporting the participant", "metadata": {"papl_version": "2025-26", "page": 29, "section_title": "", "clause_ref": "", "source_pdf_path": "data/PAPL2025-2026.pdf"}}

The SIL Operational Guideline provides more detail about the types of services that are included and excluded from the provision of SIL supports.

Further information on when a support is considered reasonable and necessary can be found on the NDIS website . Medicare and Insurance Some elements of a participant’s care may be covered by funds outside the NDIS. These expenses are commonly medical, including those covered by private health insurance or Medicare. These medical expenses are not funded under the NDIS, even if they are related to, or a symptom of, the disability. These expenses should be claimed under the relevant health care scheme or insurance policy. Some providers (e.g. , therapists) may need to distinguish between the health services and disability supports that they provide to a single client, and make separate payment claims to, for example, Medicare and the NDIS. Expenses Related to Recreational Pursuits Providers should not claim payment from participant’s plans for: • Expenses related to recreational pursuits, such as event tickets for the participant, as they are not covered by the NDIS; or • The cost of entry for a paid support worker to attend a social or recreational event. Prepayments In general, Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment once a service booking has been created and the support has been delivered or provided. For higher cost supports, the cost of the support may be claimed in stages in some circumstances, and before the support is finally delivered to the participant.

Disability -Related Health Supports The NDIS will fund disability -related health supports where these supports directly relate to a participant’s significant and permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake activities of daily living. These supports are provided individually to participants and can be provided in a range of environments, including, but not limited to, the participant’s own home. Participants are not permitted to claim for health supports from their plans when those health supports do not relate to their disability and when they do not require health supports on a regular basis. Those health supports will continue to be provided by the health system. Additionally, if a participant’s support needs become acute, that support should be provided in a hospital or another health setting by the relevant state/territory health care system or private health system and not be claimed from the participant’s plan.
